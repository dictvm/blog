I'm Daniel Heitmann and I’m a Site Reliability Engineer currently working at trivago while also offering consulting services.

I’m moving YAML around and glueing various open source components together to form reliable systems at scale. I also occasionally contribute back to some of those projects.

I’ve also been hosting the [DevOps & Infrastructure Meetup NRW](https://www.meetup.com/devops-duesseldorf/) in Düsseldorf for more than 5 years. Show up and say "Hi!" when you're there!

Apart from the doing stuff with computers, I spend a lot of time with my amazing girlfriend and our beautiful cats. To stay fit, I’m either on a bicycle, practicing Wing Tsun Kung Fu or reading books (or something from my life-long [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) backlog). If you want to see what I'm reading online, make sure to boomark this [Twitter search](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40dictvm%20%23justread&src=typed_query&f=live).

Looking to [contact me](/contact)?
