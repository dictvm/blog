My name is Daniel Heitmann and I'm a generalist Systems Engineer.

I previously worked under the umbrella of several roles such as Linux Systems Administrator, **Cloud Engineer**, **Senior Site Reliability Engineer**, **Engineering Manager** and currently as a **Lead DevOps Engineer** for a consulting company. I consider myself a pragmatic generalist who cares deeply about people and results.

## Vita
Closing in on almost 20 years of experience, I started my career in tech in 2005 when I offered webhosting services for family, friends and local businesses on a personal server. This grew into a small business that I shut down in order to finish a 3 year apprenticeship from 2008 to 2011. Since then I worked for reputable companies such as Uberspace, InVision, trivago and HiveMQ in various capacities.

## Passion
Providing reliable web services and building robust automation for complex systems are my core passions. I'm also experienced in leading engineering teams. I pride myself in resolving interpersonal conflicts, discovering talent for various engineering roles and being able to quickly dig into new areas. I deeply care about products that truly deliver value to people.

## Background

In case you're looking for someone with a strong technical background who can bring empathy and a human touch to your company or team's dynamics, look no further, as I specialize in unblocking teams and discovering organizational issues that can hinder productivity and progress. My approach to problem-solving is rooted in treating people like humans, listening and understanding their unique perspectives and needs. By doing so, I can better identify the root causes of issues and develop effective solutions that address them in a meaningful way.
