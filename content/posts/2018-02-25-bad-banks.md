After the unexpected surprise that was Babylon Berlin, it seems that Germany
is slowly on the rise in terms of being able to produce thrilling, modern TV shows.
This time it's Bad Banks, focusing on the dubious schemings of the financial sector.

Produced by ARTE and ZDF, it is now ready for streaming in the
[Mediathek](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/RC-015129/bad-banks/). Of course, thanks to German
Laws, it'll be depublished within 14 days, so you better get your local copy
while it's still available.

While certainly not in the same league as
[Billions](http://www.sho.com/billions), it's a show with high production
values, decent pacing, interesting characters and capable actors that manages to
make me want to watch episode after episode, despite having just been hooked on
Netflix' [Altered Carbon](https://www.netflix.com/title/80097140). The
cringe-worthy excessive use of German's speaking half-english is completely over
the top though, while the creepy, self-obsessed and arrogant white men are probably
much closer to the real world as one might expect.
