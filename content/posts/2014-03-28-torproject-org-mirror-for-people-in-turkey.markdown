**Update: It seems that Turkey's censorship has stopped. I have therefore disabled this mirror. Please go to [torproject.org](https://torproject.org) and make sure to get the latest version of the Tor browser-bundle.**


Dear people from Turkey, 

if you  are a victim of censorship in your country (which is quite likely right now, if you frequent Twitter and Youtube), feel free to use this mirror of the [torproject.org](https://torproject.org)-site to download the Tor browser-bundle: [https://tor.dictvm.org](https://tor.dictvm.org/)

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is also hosting a [Tor-mirror](https://tor.eff.org/) and a site with [additonal information](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/when-tor-block-not-tor-block) on the current censorship-status of Turkey and a list of additional mirrors.

Using Tor is slower than you are used to, but it is a great tool to cirumvent all kinds of censorship-attempts, whether driven by an evil government or just a boring office environment.

You can also request to get the Tor browser-bundle sent to you via email. For the windows-version, sent an empty email to the following mailaddress: [gettor@gettor.torproject.org](mailto:gettor@gettor.torproject.org)

You will then receive a request to sent either _'windows'_, _'osx'_ or _'linux'_ as a reply to this mail. You will then receive the correct version of the Tor browser-bundle.
