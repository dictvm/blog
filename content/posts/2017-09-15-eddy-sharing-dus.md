A few weeks ago, a new project named [Eddy Sharing](https://eddy-sharing.de) started renting electric scooters in Düsseldorf. The project is a spin-off of Berlin startup named [Emmy](https://emmy-sharing.de) in collaboration with the Stadtwerke. Since they started, I'm seeing Eddy scooters everywhere in the city. The difference with regards to typical scooters is that you're only seeing and not hearing them: They're silent, as one would come to expect from electronic engines.

That has an advantage I never noticed before: I'm often seeing Eddy riders talk to people on their bicycles while waiting at the traffic light. Normally this wouldn't happen because scooter engines are loud as fuck. Now that the engine is barely noticeable, motorists and cyclists can talk to each other. It brings a smile to my face whenever I notice it.

The future of transport is electric.
