Alright, yesterday I wrote about [Frustration](/frustration). Today, it's about success.

I did it. I went to the mechanic and they basically just confirmed what I read:

The secret is to be more rigorous and increase the pressure even more. After I
put 7 bars on both tires, they just popped onto the rim. Yesterday, I stopped
at about 5 bars because I feared to blow up the tire. Unless you squeezed the
tube while putting it between the tire and the rim, that's not going to happen.
