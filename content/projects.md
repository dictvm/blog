02.2015 - now: [DevOps & Infrastructure Meetup NRW](https://www.meetup.com/devops-duesseldorf/)

I’ve been hosting the  in Düsseldorf. Throughout the years I've had the pleasure of hosting speakers from big companies like Google, Microsoft and Elastic as well as local companies like sipgate, Uberspace, bee42 and many more. Show up and say "Hi!" when ~~you're there!~~ we're able to me go outside again!
